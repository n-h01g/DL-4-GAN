### Project Details

In this project, I: 
- pre-processed data and loaded by creating a dataloader;
- defined a discriminator deep network with normalization
- defined a generator deep network;
- calculated the losses for both types of adversarial networks;
- define optimizers; and
- trained networks and assessed results.
